		doctor::SID_0727:There is no power so the lifts and doors are out of action.

		amy::SID_0750:Even if The Doctor gave me a bunk up there would be no way out. There are unlikely to be Dalek parts in the research section anyway.

		doctor::SID_0755:There is no way to move that barrier.
	--*REDUNDANT
		amy::SID_0756:I can't shift that debris. I need to look elsewhere.
	--*REDUNDANT
		doctor::SID_0813:Again. Inelegant but effective.

		sylvia::SID_0814:It's them! We have to get out of here!
	--*REDUNDANT
		dalek::SID_0815:The human has been located!
	--*REDUNDANT
		doctor::SID_0816:There must be another way out of here?
	--*REDUNDANT
		sylvia::SID_0817:Come on!
	--*REDUNDANT
		doctor::SID_0818:We have to find a way of slowing the Daleks down!
	--*REDUNDANT
		doctor::SID_0819:Well, I think it's fair to say there's something behind those doors that's pretty important. And probably what we're looking for.

		doctor::SID_0820:Production Facility.
	--*REDUNDANT
		doctor::SID_0715:I've augmented the output and the magnetic field should crush anything that follows us.

		supreme::SID_0775:Exterminate! Exterminate!
	--*REDUNDANT
		doctor::SID_0863:THE END!
	--*REDUNDANT
		doctor::SID_0791:At last let's get inside. 
	--*REDUNDANT
		sylvia::SID_0536:How? I don't... 
	--*REDUNDANT
		amy::SID_0886:It didn't see me. Looks like invisibility can have its advantages.
	--*REDUNDANT
		doctor::SID_0711:I should secure these wires to the debris first. 
	--*REDUNDANT
		amy::SID_0508:Did anyone ever tell you, you can be hard to please?
