--CUT SCENE 1
--EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS  DAY
--The vast Arctic wilderness - empty but for a moving black spec moving fast across the ice.
--CLOSER - A man, CHISHOLM, riding a skidoo hard.  He's dressed in cold weather gear, but is recognizable.  His name is stitched on to his jacket. He's breathing fast.  Panicked.
--CRASH CUT TO:
--INT. ICE EXCAVATION  NIGHT
--Shovels digging at a wall of ice.  Unseen men working intently...
--CRASH CUT TO:
--EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS  DAY
--CHISHOLM racing across the ice.  Throws a panicked look over his shoulder.  Gives the skidoo more revs.
--CRASH CUT TO:
--EXT. ICE EXCAVATION  NIGHT
--Now we see that one of the men (the only one we see clearly) is CHISHOLM - he sees something, an indistinct shape buried in the ice. He turns, calls over his shoulder...
--CUT TO: EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS  DAY
	chisholm::SID_0794:Professor!  There's something here!
--CRASH CUT TO:
--EXT. ARCTIC WILDERNESS  DAY
--The track on CHISOLM's skidoo breaks.  The Skidoo swerves dangerously, before he brings it back under control.
--Chisholm steers the machine into an ice cave.
--CRASH CUT TO:
--INT. ICE EXCAVATION  NIGHT
--PROFESSOR ELIZABETH MEADOWS is looking over CHISHOLM's shoulder as he works carefully to remove the artefact in the ice.  Something that looks a little like an arm.
	meadows::SID_0795:Be careful Chisholm.  Whatever that is, it's been buried in this ice for millennia.

--CRASH CUT TO:
--INT. ICE CAVE  DAY
--CHISHOLM dismounts the bike, looks out of the cave, across the ice.  Scared.
--Starts backing away.
--Beneath his feet the ice begins to crack.  He looks down.  Terrified.
--CRASH CUT TO:
--INT. ICE EXCAVATION  NIGHT
--MEADOWS and CHISHOLM.  We see their faces as the final ice is cleared away - not what they've found.
	chisholm::SID_0796:Oh my God!
--~ 	CRASH CUT TO:
--~ 	INT. ICE CAVE -- DAY
--~ 	The ice breaks apart beneath CHISHOLM's feet.  He teeters above an opening chasm in the ice, tries to lunge for safety - but slips and plunges into the chasm.  Screaming.
--~ 	CRASH CUT TO:
--~ 	INT. ICE EXCAVATION -- NIGHT
--~ 	And from the ice where it's been buried for thousands of years, CHISHOLM removes an arm of steel with a clenched fist - a Cyberman arm!
--~ 	CUT TO:
--~ 	doctor::[TITLES]


chisholm::SID_2449:Waiting... They were waiting!
chisholm::SID_2450:I can't go back there.
chisholm::SID_2451:No... No!
chisholm::SID_2452:No!
