--CUT SCENE 2
--INT. TARDIS  DAY
--The DOCTOR and AMY.  He's leaning against the TARDIS console, looks like he's cradling an air guitar as he demonstrates for Amy.
	doctor::SID_0797:He never could get his fingers around G Sharp.
	amy::SID_0798:You're actually telling me you taught Elvis to play guitar?
	doctor::SID_0799:Well, not very well. Obviously.
	--And his eye is caught by a light flashing on the console.
	doctor::SID_0800:How long has that been flashing?
	--And as Amy looks, he's already moving around the console, quickly checking and calibrating the controls.
	amy::SID_0801:Search me. What is it?
	doctor::SID_0802:Someone's sending an SOS. 
	amy::SID_0803:To the TARDIS?
	doctor::SID_0804:I doubt it. To any one that's passing. Generally people aren't choosy who answers when they send a distress signal. Here we go...
	--CUT TO:  Ice cave
