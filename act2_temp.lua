	--CUT SCENE 15
	--INT. SUPREME COUNCIL CHAMBER -- DAY
	--The floating metallic sphere opens to reveal the Eye of Time - which in a storm of contained energy grows to fill the magnetic field. 
	--THE DOCTOR regards with stunned horror...
		doctor::SID_0683:No... It can't be...
		amy::SID_0684:What is it?
		doctor::SID_0685:The Eye of Time. More powerful than the heart of any TARDIS. More than the power of every TARDIS ever built. 
		doctor::SID_0686:Harnessed by the Time Lords centuries ago, and lost at the Fall of Gallifrey. 
		amy::SID_0687:Lost?
		doctor::SID_0688:The Eye is a natural phenomenon. Some say it is the heart of time and space itself. The very core of the Big Bang. 
		doctor::SID_0689:The Time Lords contained it in a powerful ion field. But when Gallifrey was destroyed it vanished into the universe.
		emperor::SID_0690:The Daleks found it. It is ours. Daleks are the new Time Lords. 
	--That gets the Doctor angry.
		doctor::SID_0691:The Time Lords used their powers to benefit the universe, not to crush it!
		emperor::SID_0692:You were weak. Soon, throughout all time and space there will be only Daleks!
		doctor::SID_0695:No, your time just ran out!
	--And the Doctor fires the sonic at a nearby panel - setting off a chain reaction of diversionary explosions.
		emperor::SID_0841:Exterminate the Doctor!
	--The Doctor and Amy run towards the Eye of Time.
		doctor::SID_0842:Erm... Amy... Run!
		dalek::SID_0843:Exterminate! Exterminate!
	--They dodge Dalek blasts as the Doctor fires the sonic at the Eye's control panel.
		dalek::SID_0844:Exterminate! Exterminate!
	--And the Doctor and Amy leap into the Eye!
		doctor::SID_1163:GERONIMO!
