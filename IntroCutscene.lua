--[[ACT TWO]]
	--CUT SCENE 9
	--EXT. SKARO/KAALANN -- DAY
	--Skaro, the strange a menacing home world of the Daleks. Two moons hang in the sky.
	--Yellow acid rain falls incessantly from vast storm clouds that stretch towards distant forbidding mountains.
	--As the camera pans down to discover Kaalann - the magnificently sinister City of the Daleks. 
	--The camera closes on the towering Central Building. As we hear the sound of the TARDIS...
	--CUT TO:
	--INT. STOREROOM FACILITY -- DAY
	--The TARDIS materializes. The Doctor cautiously opens the door, and steps out. Amy follows him - and comes face to face with a Dalek. 
	--She gasps with horror.
		amy::SID_1227:Gasp!
	--Instantly reassured by the Doctor, who raps the Dalek on the head - it sounds dead and hollow.
		doctor::SID_0583:It's all right. Nobody home. 
	--They look around them. The room is filled with Dalek parts.
		amy::SID_0584:What is this? The Dalek graveyard?
		doctor::SID_0585:More like a junkyard, I'd say. The Daleks aren't just the most deadly race in the universe, they're also the most pragmatic. 
		doctor::SID_0586:Don't waste anything. The old shells are going for recycling.
		amy::SID_0587:Who'd have thought Daleks would be green?
	--Cut to a breathtaking view of Kaalann (Matte Painting).
		doctor::SID_0588:And they've been busy re-building this place, too.
		amy::SID_0589:Re-building?
		doctor::SID_0590:Kaalann. City of the Daleks. The last time I saw it, it was in ruins. And the Daleks had fled. But now Kaalann is reborn.
		amy::SID_0591:Yeah, well I'm still not coming here for my holidays.
		doctor::SID_0592:Don't blame you. It never stops raining, so I wouldn't go outside. Even with an umbrella. 
		doctor::SID_0822:The atmosphere is thirty per cent sulphuric acid. 
	--Amy shudders.
		amy::SID_0593:Ugh... No wonder they're so screwed up.
	--But the Doctor is energized.
		doctor::SID_0594:Come on. We have to find the source of the Daleks' time manipulation and stop them. Whatever that takes.
